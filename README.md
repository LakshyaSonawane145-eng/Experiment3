# Experiment 3: Study of Tuples in Python

## Aim

To study and understand the concept of **tuples in Python** and perform basic operations on tuples using simple programs.

---

## Theory

A **tuple** in Python is an ordered collection of elements enclosed within parentheses `()`. Tuples are **immutable**, meaning once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed. Tuples can store multiple values of different data types such as integers, floats, strings, etc.

Key characteristics of tuples:

* Ordered
* Immutable
* Allows duplicate values
* Can store different data types

Example:

```python
t = (10, 20, "python", 3.5)
```

Tuples are mainly used when the data should remain constant throughout the program.

## Algorithms

### Problem 1: Operations on Tuple

**Steps:**

1. Create a tuple with multiple elements.
2. Access elements of the tuple using indexing.
3. Display selected elements of the tuple.
4. Print the complete tuple.

---

### Problem 2: Tuple Properties Program

**Steps:**

1. Create a tuple with different values.
2. Find the length of the tuple.
3. Access elements using slicing.
4. Display the results.

## Conclusion

In this experiment, the concept of tuples in Python was studied and implemented. The programs demonstrated how tuples are created, accessed, and used in programs. The immutability of tuples was also understood. This experiment helped in learning how tuples can be used to store fixed data efficiently in Python programs.
