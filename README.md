# Experiment 3: Study of Tuples in Python

## Aim

To study and understand the concept of **tuples in Python** and perform basic operations on tuples using simple programs.

---

## Theory

A **tuple** in Python is an ordered collection of elements enclosed within parentheses `()`. Tuples are **immutable**, meaning once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be changed. Tuples can store multiple values of different data types such as integers, floats, strings, etc.

- Key characteristics of tuples:
- A tuple is an ordered and immutable collection in Python.
- Tuples are created using round brackets ().
- They can store multiple data types in a single tuple.
- Tuple elements are accessed using indexing and negative indexing.
- Slicing is used to extract a part of a tuple.
- Tuples support repetition using the * operator.
- Built-in functions like len(), max(), min(), sum(), and sorted() work on tuples.
- Tuple unpacking allows assigning values to multiple variables at once.
- Tuples have limited methods like count() and index().
- Due to immutability, tuples ensure data safety and integrity.
- Tuples are mainly used when the data should remain constant throughout the program.

## Algorithms
**Algorithm 1**: Student Result Evaluation (Tuple Unpacking & Decision Making)
- Start
- Store subject, marks, and grade in a tuple
- Unpack the tuple into variables subject, marks, and grade
- Display the subject, marks, and grade
- Check if marks ≥ 75
- If true, display “Distinction”
- Else, display “No Distinction”
- Stop

**Algorithm 2**: Attendance Analysis Using Tuple
- Start
- Store attendance status ("P" and "A") in a tuple
- Count the number of "P" using the count() method
- Count the number of "A" using the count() method
- Display total present days
- Display total absent days
- Check whether "A" is present in the tuple
- If true, display “Employee was absent at least once”
- Stop


## Conclusion

In this experiment, the concept of tuples in Python was studied and implemented. The programs demonstrated how tuples are created, accessed, and used in programs. The immutability of tuples was also understood. This experiment helped in learning how tuples can be used to store fixed data efficiently in Python programs.
